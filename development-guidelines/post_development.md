# Post-development Guidelines

Once the contract has been developed:

- **Monitor your contracts.** Watch the logs, and be ready to react in case of contract or wallet compromise.
- **Add your contact info to [blockchain-security-contacts](https://github.com/crytic/blockchain-security-contacts).** This list helps third-parties contact you if a security flaw is discovered.
- **Secure the wallets of privileged users.** Follow our [best practices](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/11/27/10-rules-for-the-secure-use-of-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallets/) if you keys store hardware wallets.
- **Have a response to incident plan.** Take in consideration that you can be compromised. Even if your contracts are free of bugs, an attacker may take control of the contract owner's keys.
